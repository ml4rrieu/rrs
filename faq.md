## What is the purpose of the RRS ? 

The Right Retention Strategy, translated in french as _Stratégie de non céssion des droits_, aims to empower open access. It is an initiative from a consortium of research funders, the Coaliation S, which promote immediate open access without requyring payment to publish (no Article Processing Charges) 

## How does it work ? 

Directly at the beginning of the submission process, the authors state to the publisher that they will appy a CC BY licence to the accepted version of their manuscript. Thanks to the CC BY licence the authors are free to deposit the accepted version of their paper in an open access repository like [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)

## What is a CC BY licence
The most common Open Access licence : 

> **CC** : Creative Commons licenses give everyone from individual creators to large institutions a standardized way to grant the public permission to use their creative work under copyright law. From the reuser’s perspective, the presence of a Creative Commons license on a copyrighted work answers the question, “What can I do with this work?” 

> **BY** : license allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. The license allows for commercial use

[creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/)


## How to apply the RRS ? 

In its simplest form :

* Add the following sentence in the _acknowledgments_ section of your manuscript

> For the purpose of Open Access, the author has applied a CC BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM) version arising from this submission

* Submit your manuscript. And You can already share the preprint version on a repository

* Once you're paper is accepted for publication, deposit the current version (named "Acepted Author Manusrcipt") in a repository

* That's it !

## What is the Author Accepted Manuscrit and the Publisher Version ? 

There are basically three steps in the publication process, corresponding to three versions : 
* _Preprint_, is the version you submit to a publisher 
* _Author Accepted Manuscript_ is the one after the reviewing process and before the layout work done by the publisher 
* _Publisher version_ is one with the journal and publisher logos, where the final layout has been done.

## What is the idea of the RRS ? 

The idea of the Right Retention Strategy is that the author ceases to transfer his copyright to the publisher _on all the three versions of a paper_, but transferts it only for the last version, the one where the publisher adds that extra value (copy edyting + layout for example).

The author retains the rights on the _preprint_ and the _Author Accepted Version_ and makes them openly available through a repository with a CC BY license.


## How do you get the publications listed in that website ?

It is a query for papers in the [french repository HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr) where the sentence _the author has applied a CC BY public copyright licence_ has been inserted.

## How often will the data be updated?

Once per month

## Please describe the columns of the table (data schema)

* deposit date
