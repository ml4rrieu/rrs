## What is the purpose of the RRS ? 

The Right Retention Strategy, translated in french as _Stratégie de non céssion des droits_, aims to empower open access. It is an initiative from a consortium of research funders, the Coaliation S, which promote immediate open access without requyring payment to publish (no Article Processing Charges) 

## How does it work ? 

Directly at the beginning of the submission process, the authors state to the publisher that they will appy a CC BY licence to the accepted version of their manuscript. Thanks to the CC BY the authors are free to deposit the accepted version of their paper in an open access repository like [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)


## How to apply the RRS ? 

In its simplest form :

* Add the following sentence in the _acknowledgments_ section of your manuscript

> For the purpose of Open Access, the author has applied a CC BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM) version arising from this submission

* Submit your manuscript. And You can already share the preprint version on a repository

* Once you're paper is accepted for publication, deposit the current version (named "Acepted Author Manusrcipt") in a repository

* That's it !

## What is the Author Accepted Manuscrit and the Publisher Version ? 

There are basically three steps in the publication of a paper with three corresponding versions : 
* _Preprint_, is the version you submit to a publisher 
* _Author Accepted Manuscript_ is the one after the reviewing process and before the layout work done by the publsiher 
* _ publisher version_ is one with the journal and publisher logos, where the layout has been done. 



## How do you get the publications listed in that website ?

We search for papers in the [french repository HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr) where the sentence _the author has applied a CC BY public copyright licence_ has been inserted.
