## French Right Retention Strategy Monitor


[https://ml4rrieu.github.io/rrs](https://ml4rrieu.github.io/rrs)


Repository of the website "french RRS monitor". This jekyll website shed light on the french publications where the Right Retention Strategy has been applied.


## Memo

launch jekyll website in local `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`


## ToDo Ideas

- add journal title ?
- add journal OA type ?
cons : the more you describe journal type the less you promote diversity. Try to describe scientific productions without focusing on journals.
